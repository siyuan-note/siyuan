* [SiYuan Change logs](CHANGELOG.md)

## üõ†Ô∏è Download Setup

It is recommended to give priority to installing through the application market on the desktop and mobile, so that you can upgrade the version with one click in the future.

### App Market

* [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/siyuan/id1583226508)
* [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.b3log.siyuan)
* [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9P7HPMXP73K4)

### Docker Hosting

<details>
<summary>Docker Deployment</summary>

#### Overview

The easiest way to serve SiYuan on a server is to deploy it through Docker.

* Image name `b3log/siyuan`
* [Image URL](https://hub.docker.com/r/b3log/siyuan)

#### File structure

The overall program is located under `/opt/siyuan/`, which is basically the structure under the resources folder of the Electron installation package:

* appearance: icon, theme, languages
* guide: user guide document
* stage: interface and static resources
* kernel: kernel program

#### Entrypoint

The entry point is set when building the Docker image: `ENTRYPOINT ["/opt/siyuan/kernel" ]`, use `docker run b3log/siyuan` with parameters to start:

* `--workspace` specifies the workspace folder path, mounted to the container via `-v` on the host

More parameters can refer to `--help`. The following is an example of a startup command: `docker run -v workspace_dir_host:workspace_dir_container -p 6806:6806 b3log/siyuan --workspace=workspace_dir_container`

* `workspace_dir_host`: the workspace folder path on the host
* `workspace_dir_container`: The path of the workspace folder in the container, which is the same as specified in `--workspace`

To simplify, it is recommended to configure the workspace folder path to be consistent on the host and container, such as: `workspace_dir_host` and `workspace_dir_container` are configured as `/siyuan/workspace`, the corresponding startup commands is: `docker run -v /siyuan/workspace:/siyuan/workspace -p 6806:6806 -u 1000:1000 b3log/siyuan --workspace=/siyuan/workspace/`.

#### User permissions

In the image, the normal user `siyuan` (uid 1000/gid 1000) created by default is used to start the kernel process. Therefore, when the host creates a workspace folder, please pay attention to setting the user group of the folder:  `chown -R 1000:1000 /siyuan/workspace`. The parameter `-u 1000:1000` is required when starting the container.

#### Hidden port

Use NGINX reverse proxy to hide port 6806, please note:

* Configure WebSocket reverse proxy `/ws`

## ‚ùì FAQ

### How does SiYuan store data?

The data is saved in the workspace folder (the default is in the user's home directory Documents/SiYuan, which can be modified in <kbd>Settings</kbd> - <kbd>About</kbd>), in the workspace data folder:

* `assets` are used to save all inserted asset files
* `templates` are used to save template snippets
* `widgets` are used to save widgets
* `emojis` are used to save emoji images
* The rest of the folders are the notebook folders created by the user, files with the suffix of `.sy` in the notebook folder are used to save the document data, and the data format is JSON

### Is SiYuan open source?

SiYuan is completely open source, and contributions are welcome:

* [User Guide](https://github.com/siyuan-note/user-guide-en_US)
* [Appearance](https://github.com/siyuan-note/appearance)
* [Data Parser](https://github.com/88250/protyle)
* [Editor Engine](https://github.com/88250/lute)

* [iOS](https://github.com/siyuan-note/siyuan-ios)

For more details, please refer to [Development Guide](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Is there any note for deleting docs?

After deletion, the doc will not appear in the operating system's recycle bin, but will be deleted directly. When deleted, SiYuan will generate edit history.

### How can I just wrap and not start a new paragraph?

Please use <kbd>Shift+Enter</kbd>.

### How to move the heading and blocks below it?

Fold the heading and move it later.

### How to select multiple blocks across pages?

Click at the beginning, hold down <kbd>Shift</kbd> and click at the end after scrolling the page.

### How to adjust table rows and columns?

There is an operation entry in the block icon menu of the table block.

### How to use a third-party sync disk for data synchronization?

* Please only synchronize the `workspace/data/`, do not synchronize the entire workspace
* Please suspend third-party synchronization during the operation of SiYuan, otherwise data may be damaged. For details, please refer to [here](https://ld246.com/article/1626537583158)
* The data folder path on the Android is `internal storage device/Android/data/org.b3log.siyuan/files/siyuan/data/`, which is a private path of the application and cannot be read by other programs and can only be copied manually
* There is a conflict between third-party synchronization and SiYuan synchronization, please do not use at the same time

### What should I do if I forget the end-to-end password?

* Use the new workspace on the main device, manually copy the old workspace data folder to the new workspace
* New workspace can reset password
* The cloud uses the new cloud synchronization directory

If it is a mobile-end, uninstall and reinstall it (note: When the mobile-enduninstalls the application, the local workspace data will be deleted together).

### Do I need to pay for it?

Local functions are completely free to use, [Cloud services](https://b3log.org/siyuan/pricing.html) requires annual subscription, price is $72/year„ÄÇ

Users in non-Mainland China regions should not pay for subscriptions, because SiYuan Cloud Server cannot guarantee availability in non-Mainland China regions.
