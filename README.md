## üöÄ Download Setup

It is recommended to give priority to installing through the application market on the desktop and mobile, so that you can upgrade the version with one click in the future.

### App Market

* [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/siyuan/id1583226508)
* [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.b3log.siyuan)
* [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9P7HPMXP73K4)

### Docker Hosting

<details>
<summary>Docker Deployment</summary>

#### Overview

The easiest way to serve SiYuan on a server is to deploy it through Docker.

* Image name `b3log/siyuan`
* [Image URL](https://hub.docker.com/r/b3log/siyuan)

#### File structure

The overall program is located under `/opt/siyuan/`, which is basically the structure under the resources folder of the Electron installation package:

* appearance: icon, theme, languages
* guide: user guide document
* stage: interface and static resources
* kernel: kernel program

#### Entrypoint

The entry point is set when building the Docker image: `ENTRYPOINT ["/opt/siyuan/kernel" ]`, use `docker run b3log/siyuan` with parameters to start:

* `--workspace`: Specifies the workspace folder path, mounted to the container via `-v` on the host
* `--accessAuthCode`: Specifies the access authorization code

More parameters can refer to `--help`. The following is an example of a startup command:

```
docker run -v workspace_dir_host:workspace_dir_container -p 6806:6806 b3log/siyuan --workspace=workspace_dir_container --accessAuthCode=xxx
```

* `workspace_dir_host`: The workspace folder path on the host
* `workspace_dir_container`: The path of the workspace folder in the container, which is the same as specified in `--workspace`
* `accessAuthCode`: Access authorization code, please **be sure to modify**, otherwise anyone can read and write your data

To simplify, it is recommended to configure the workspace folder path to be consistent on the host and container, such as: `workspace_dir_host` and `workspace_dir_container` are configured as `/siyuan/workspace`, the corresponding startup commands is:

```
docker run -v /siyuan/workspace:/siyuan/workspace -p 6806:6806 -u 1000:1000 b3log/siyuan --workspace=/siyuan/workspace/ --accessAuthCode=xxx
```

#### User permissions

In the image, the normal user `siyuan` (uid 1000/gid 1000) created by default is used to start the kernel process. Therefore, when the host creates a workspace folder, please pay attention to setting the user group of the folder:  `chown -R 1000:1000 /siyuan/workspace`. The parameter `-u 1000:1000` is required when starting the container.

#### Hidden port

Use NGINX reverse proxy to hide port 6806, please note:

* Configure WebSocket reverse proxy `/ws`

#### Note

* Be sure to confirm the correctness of the mounted volume, otherwise the data will be lost after the container is deleted
* Do not use URL rewriting for redirection, otherwise there may be problems with authentication, it is recommended to configure a reverse proxy

#### Limitations

* Does not support desktop and mobile application connections, only supports use on browsers
* Export to PDF, HTML and Word formats is not supported
* Import Markdown file is not supported
