## Overview

This version improves some details.

Important changes: List Markdown marker changed from `*` to `-` ([#14680](https://github.com/siyuan-note/siyuan/issues/14680))

**Affected scope**:

1. When copying or exporting list Markdown, the marker is changed to `-`
2. SQL query statements or plugins that rely on the list `*` marker need to adjust their logic

Does not affect input, and the `*` marker can still be used for input.

**Adaptation operation**:

1. Execute `Doc Tree` - `More` - `Rebuild Index` to update the list markers in the data index
2. Modify the relevant SQL query statements
   * Only support the new format: for example, change `markdown LIKE '* [x]%'` to `markdown LIKE '- [x]%'`
   * Compatible with new and old formats: for example, change to `markdown LIKE '- [x]%' OR markdown LIKE '* [x]%'`
